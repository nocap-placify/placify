FEATURED PROJECTS
Kryptonite C, RISC-V, RISC-V Assembly
GitHub
• Created an Operating System for the 32-bit RISC-V ISA, using the RISC-V OpenSBI for communication between
the Operating System and QEMU. Wrote a linker script from scratch for defining the memory layout.
• Implemented standard library functions such as printf, memcpy, memset, strncpy, and strncmp from scratch.
• Designed and implemented kernel exception handling, panic mechanisms, dynamic memory allocation, context
switching, process creation and a paging system from scratch.
MemStream C, Python, Docker, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana, Makefile
GitHub
• Built a shared key-value pair memory caching system with POSIX SHM (shared memory), pthread read-write
locks and a thread-safe memory management scheme from scratch.
• Developed a distributed logging framework with Apache Kafka and Elasticsearch in Docker containers, in-
tegrating Kibana for real-time analytics and visualization, adding real-time health monitoring via heartbeat
mechanisms.
• Engineered a Docker-containerized microservices ecosystem (Read, Write, Analytics) using Python-C interop-
erability with ctypes and real-time performance monitoring for containerized services.
Quarantine C, Linux, Makefile
GitHub
• Developed a lightweight containerization system using Linux namespaces (UTS, User, Mount and PID) and cgroups
for process isolation.
• Implemented resource control mechanisms to limit CPU and memory usage via cgroups.
• Integrated an Alpine-based root filesystem with a custom script and used chroot for environment isolation.
GitHub
Placify GO, PostgreSQL, TypeScript
• Created a full-stack application for a comprehensive view of a student’s activities beyond the classroom.
• Written the complete backend using GoLang, and using the gorm module for database operations.
• Hosted a PostgreSQL database on a personal server mimicking a real world scenario with API calls from the
frontend to fetch the required data.
GitHub
BitFusion1.0 C, Makefile
• Designed and developed a 16-bit process virtual machine based on the Little Computer-3 architecture.
• Implemented instruction decoding, execution, and memory management features.
• Written completely using the standard C library without any external libraries.
